<p>Tekken 7 Originals Edition and Tekken 7 Definitive Edition have been announced by Bandai Namco. This heavily implies that the development for Tekken 7 DLC content has fully wrapped up.</p>

<p>Both editions are noted to be "digital only" for the Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Steam. 
The Originals Edition version of the game can be picked up for $89.99 while the Definitive Edition is priced at $109.99.
Tekken 7 Originals Edition is similar to the European Tekken 7 Legendary Edition, but there are some differences.</p> 
<p>Most of the DLC fighters are included, but there are some omissions in terms of the 3rd parties.
The characters that come with Tekken 7 Originals Edition are Eliza, Anna Williams, Lei Wulong, Craig Marduk, Armor King, Julia Chang, Zafina, Ganryu, Leroy Smith, Fahkumram, Kunimitsu and Lidia Sobieska. This version of the game also comes with the frame data feature that was previously implemented as paid DLC.
Notably, Tekken 7 Originals Edition includes 4 more characters over the European Legendary Edition. 
These fighters are Eliza, Leroy Smith, Fahkumram and Lidia Sobieska.</p>
<p>However, it's the Tekken 7 Definitive Edition that's apparently intended to function as a complete package for Tekken 7. All third party characters that were omitted from the Tekken 7 Legendary Edition and Tekken 7 Originals Edition have been included.
In addition to the DLC characters that the Originals Edition adds to Tekken 7, the Definitive Edition also get Geese Howard from Fatal Fury, Noctis Lucis Caelum from Final Fantasy 15 and Negan from the Walking Dead.
Notably, since Akuma from Capcom's Street Fighter series is included in Tekken 7's base roster, he's still playable in Tekken 7 Legendary Edition and Tekken 7 Originals Edition.</p>
<p>Tekken 7 Definitive Edition also comes with Ultimate Tekken Bowl mode, Frame Data Display, the Cave of Enlightenment stage, the Vermillion Gates stage, the Island Paradise stage, alternate costumes released in Season 1 and customization sets from all 4 seasons.</p>
